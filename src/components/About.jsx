      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a passionate full-stack developer with a year of experience in React.js and React Native. 
        I’ve built web and mobile apps using technologies like Supabase, Firebase, and Socket.IO. 
        Recently, I integrated face comparison into an attendance management app, showcasing my ability 
        to solve complex problems. I’m currently expanding my skills in AWS, AI, and CI/CD to build 
        scalable and efficient applications.
